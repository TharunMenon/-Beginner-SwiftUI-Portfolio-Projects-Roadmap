# -Beginner-SwiftUI-Portfolio-Projects-Roadmap
Beginner SwiftUI projects include a To-Do List app, Weather app, and Expense Tracker. They teach layouts, state, navigation, networking, JSON parsing, and data persistence while reinforcing MVVM. Small yet practical, these apps are portfolio-ready with support for dark mode and accessibility.
